                The other day, talking with my children about today's society and how kids are choosing to spend their available time off , i found myself thinking about my childhood. My childhood felt secure even thou i was born and raised in a communist country or at least it felt or seemed secured.
            </p>
            <p>  Beautiful summer long days , playing for hours with friends mostly outdoors, walking quite of a distance to movies at a age when i was probably 8 y.o., spending some time in the house with friends when the weather did not cooperate, or awesome cold and snowy winters, building snomen and igloo houses, fighting with snow balls not worry for a second of anything but just enjoying every moment with friends.
            </p> 
            <p>  However quickly i have come to realize that there was not much freedom of expression or freedom of travel .
